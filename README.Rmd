The goal of **impIndicator** is to allow users to seamlessly calculate and visualise the impact of alien taxa and individual species in a given area. It calculates and visualises potential impact per site as a map. It takes in GBIF occurrence data and EICAT assessment data. It enables users to choose from various methods 
of calculating impact indicators based on different assumptions.\

The impIndicator produces three main products and can be useful as stated below:\

- **overall impact indicator** <`compute_impact_indicator()`>\
The impact indicator offers a nuanced representation of the trends of biological invasions of an area (local, regional, or global scales). By tracking the increase and decrease of ecological threats over time, this product provides insights into the dynamics of alien species impacts, helping assess whether current management practices are effective or need adjustment. The temporal analysis of impact indicator enables targeted resource allocation, fostering proactive interventions to mitigate biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.\
- **site impact indicator** <`compute_impact_per_site()`>\
The site impact as a map serves as a visual and analytical tool to represent the intensity of biological invasions across different parts of an area. By enabling spatial comparisons—such as between provinces, states, or conservation areas—, it highlights hotspots and areas at risk of invasion impact. This spatial data is useful for prioritising management actions, coordinating restoration projects, and fostering cross-regional collaboration to address alien species impacts effectively.\
- **species impact indicator** <`compute_impact_per_species()`>\
The species impact produces the trends of individual alien species, enabling a species-specific impact attributed to invasions. This data supports comparisons of individual species’ impacts, revealing their roles and interactions within invaded area. The species impact is invaluable for prioritising species-specific management efforts, informing control and eradication strategies, and advancing research on alien species' ecological roles and adaptation patterns.

## Installation

Install **impIndicator** in R:

```r
install.packages("impIndicator", repos = "https://b-cubed-eu.r-universe.dev")
```

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("b-cubed-eu/impIndicator")
```

## Demonstration

We demonstrate the computation and visualisation of impact indicator of biological invasions using the **impIndicator** package: the `impact_indicator()` function to compute impact indicators of alien taxa, the `species_impact()` function to compute impact indicators per species, and the `site_impact()` function to compute impact indicators per site. The functions require (1) a species occurrence cube processed by the `b3gbi::process_cube()` function within `taxa_cube()`, and (2) Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) impact score of species. Go to `vignette("Background", package = "impIndicator")` to read more about these functions.

```{r load packages, message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(impIndicator)

library(b3gbi)     # General biodiversity indicators for data cubes
library(ggplot2)   # Visualisation
library(tidyr)     # Data wrangling
```

### Process occurrence cube

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) occurrence data is a standardised species dataset that documents the presence or absence of species at particular locations and time points.

```{r}
# Process cube from GBIF occurrence data in the R studio environment
acacia_cube <- taxa_cube(
  taxa = taxa_Acacia,
  region = southAfrica_sf,
  first_year = 2010
)

acacia_cube
```

### EICAT assessment data

The Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) assessment data is the reported impact of alien taxa based on EICAT method which is the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) standard. An assessed alien taxa with adequate data is classified into massive (MV), major (MR), moderate (MO), minor (MN), or minimal concern (MC) depending on the severity of the impact caused on recipient ecosystem. Additional information such as the mechanisms and location of impact are also recorded. 
An example of an EICAT dataset is:

```{r}
# View EICAT data
head(eicat_acacia, 10)
```

### Compute impact map

The impact risk map shows the impact score for each site, where multiple species can be present. To compute the impact risk per site, aggregated scores across species at each site are needed. The `site_impact()` uses *max*, *sum* and *mean* metrics to aggregate impact scores across species as proposed by Boulesnane-Guengant et al., (in preparation). The combinations of within species aggregation metrics for each species and across species for each site leads to five methods of calculating an impact indicator, namely, **precautionary** (precaut), 
**precautionary cumulative** (precaut_cum), **mean**, **mean cumulative** (mean_cum) and **cumulative** (cum).\

```{r}
siteImpact <- compute_impact_per_site(
  cube = acacia_cube,
  impact_data = eicat_acacia,
  method = "mean_cum"
)

# Impact map
# Visualise last four years for readability
plot(x = siteImpact, region = southAfrica_sf, first_year = 2021)
```

### Compute impact indicators

To compute the impact indicator of alien taxa, we sum all the yearly impact scores of each site of the study region. To correct for sampling effort we divide the yearly impact scores by number of sites in the study region with at least a single occurrence throughout the whole year.

```{r}
# Impact indicator
impactIndicator <- compute_impact_indicator(
  cube = acacia_cube,
  impact_data = eicat_acacia,
  method = "mean_cum"
)

# Visualise impact indicator
plot(impactIndicator)
```

### Impact indicator per species

We compute the impact indicator per species by summing the impact risk map per species and correct for sampling effort by dividing by $N$.

```{r}
# Impact indicator per species
species_value <- compute_impact_per_species(
  cube = acacia_cube,
  impact_data = eicat_acacia,
  method = "mean"
)

# Visualise species impact
plot(species_value)
```
