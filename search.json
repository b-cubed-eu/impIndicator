Various indicators proposed used track invasions time (Vicente et al., 2022; Wilson et al., 2018). Indicators focussing occurrence alien species include cumulative number established alien species (Henriksen et al., 2024) relative abundance alien species [8,9]. indicators based species occurrence provide trends invasion generally, necessarily depict trend impact ecosystem. Also, capture variability magnitude impact caused alien species. occurrence-based indicator can advanced incorporating impact variability species account limitations. Red List Index (RLI) alien species impact indicator uses change extinction risk native species caused alien species evidence impact ecosystem [10–12]. RLI based IUCN Red List Threatened Species categorises species status range Least Concern Extinct. Changes Red List categories can attributed factors alien species. , changes can serve useful proxy gauging magnitude alien species’ impacts native biodiversity [12]. Although RLI reflects variation alien species affect native species, fully capture specific magnitude impacts mechanisms alien species exert impacts broader ecosystem. species’ impact magnitude mechanisms coupled alien species distribution can provide better representation alien species impact recipient ecosystem. Moreover, RLI evidence based classification relies heavily expert opinion, makes comparison across timescales difficult. Environmental Impact Classification Alien Taxa (EICAT), recently adopted IUCN, offers information impact alien species mechanisms thereof [13]. Alien species categorised Minimal Massive levels concern, depending magnitude impact reported native species [14,15]. Combining impact alien species occurrence can give representation alien species particular region [16]. combination data impacts occurrences proposed indicator impact invasions [9], standardised methodology achieve practice.
