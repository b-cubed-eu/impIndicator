<p>The negative impact of alien species is one of the leading causes of
biodiversity loss [1]. A challenge to the appropriate management of such
impact is the lack of sufficient evidence-based indicators for the
impact caused by alien species that satisfy Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles of data [2]. As there is
growing information on distributions (GBIF, 2025), and standard
assessments of the impact caused by alien species across different
native ecosystems become available [e.g., 3–6] ,there is room for a
standard method to infer the impact of alien species as indicators from
the combination of their occurrences and impact assessment. In terms of
policy, the indicator will allow for the prioritisation of key species
and sites, tracking the response of controls, and forecasting the impact
under possible future scenarios [7].</p>
<p>Various indicators have been proposed to be used to track invasions
over time (Vicente et al., 2022; Wilson et al., 2018). Indicators
focussing on the occurrence of the alien species include the cumulative
number of established alien species (Henriksen et al., 2024) and the
relative abundance of alien species [8,9]. While indicators based on
species occurrence provide trends of invasion generally, they do not
necessarily depict the trend of the impact on the ecosystem. Also, they
do not capture the variability of the magnitude of the impact caused by
the alien species. This occurrence-based indicator can be advanced by
incorporating impact variability between species to account for these
limitations.</p>
<p>The Red List Index (RLI) of alien species is an impact indicator that
uses the change in extinction risk of native species caused by alien
species as evidence of impact on the ecosystem [10–12]. The RLI is based
on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species which categorises species
into a status between the range of Least Concern to Extinct. Changes in
Red List categories can be attributed to factors such as alien species.
Because of this, these changes can serve as a useful proxy for gauging
the magnitude of alien species’ impacts on native biodiversity [12].
Although the RLI reflects variation in how alien species affect native
species, it does not fully capture the specific magnitude of impacts or
the mechanisms by which alien species exert those impacts on the broader
ecosystem. These species’ impact magnitude and mechanisms coupled with
alien species distribution can provide a better representation of alien
species impact on the recipient ecosystem. Moreover, the RLI is not an
evidence based classification and relies heavily on expert opinion,
which makes comparison across timescales difficult.</p>
<p>The Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT),
recently adopted by the IUCN, offers information about the impact of
alien species and mechanisms thereof [13]. Alien species are categorised
from Minimal to Massive levels of concern, depending on the magnitude of
impact reported on native species [14,15]. Combining the impact of alien
species and their occurrence can give the representation of the alien
species in a particular region [16]. The combination of data on impacts
and occurrences has been proposed as an indicator of the impact of
invasions [9], but there has been no standardised methodology to achieve
this in practice. Recent research has seen significant practical
developments to address this shortcoming. For example, [7] used EICAT
and species distribution to map the impact of Acacia species in South
Africa. The authors transformed the EICAT categories into numerical
values and computed the impact score for each site. Building on their
approach, we now derive species-specific impact values over time to
produce more refined impact indicators. In doing so, we expand the
methods of [7] and [17] by integrating open-source EICAT assessments and
species occurrence data, making the impact indicators taxonomically,
spatially, and temporally explicit. As part of the B3 project (<a href="https://b-cubed.eu/" class="external-link uri">https://b-cubed.eu/</a>), we
developed a workflow to calculate the impact indicator which visualises
the impact of alien species over time and across space. The workflow is
embedded in an R package following a standard software development guide
[18]. The workflow produces three main products which include (i) a
species impact indicator, (ii) a site impact indicator and (iii) an
overall impact indicator.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ocurrences-data">Ocurrences data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ocurrences-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The workflow uses the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)
occurrence data (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/" class="external-link uri">https://www.gbif.org/</a>). GBIF is the largest database for
biodiversity information that adheres to FAIR Data Principles and is the
most widely used for scientific purposes, demonstrating its reliability.
The workflow uses an occurrence cube - a data format which aggregates
occurrences along spatial, taxonomical and temporal scale - suitable for
modelling and computational analysis. The GBIF provides options for
spatial resolution for aggregating occurrences, such as the European
Environmental Agency (EEA) or the Extended Quarter Degree Grid Cells
(QDGC) commonly employed in South African atlas projects. The downloaded
GBIF occurrence cube is then processed using the b3gbi R package. This
ensures standardised input data for further analysis and verifies that
the data format is correct. Alternatively, an occurrence cube with
customised site resolution and code can be built from GBIF occurrence
data within the workflow. To correct for sampling bias, all computations
convert multiple species occurrences at each site per year into binary
presence (1) or absence (0) values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="impact-data">Impact data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#impact-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The workflow uses EICAT impact assessments which categorise the
impact of an alien species into minimal concern (MC), minor (MN),
moderate (MO), major (MR), or massive (MV) based on the severity of the
species’ negative impact caused on the native species of the recipient
community. Specifically, a species is assigned<br>
MC - if there is no reduction in the performance of individuals of a
native species<br>
MN - if the performance of individuals is reduced, but there is no
decrease in native species population size<br>
MO - if the native species’ population reduces<br>
MR - if impact led to species’ local extinction but naturally
reversible<br>
MV - if impact led to naturally irreversible extirpation or
extinction.<br></p>
<p>The impacts are also classified based on the 12 mechanisms described
by the IUCN which include competition, predation, hybridisation,
transmission of disease, parasitism, poisoning/toxicity, bio-fouling or
other direct physical disturbance, grazing/herbivory/browsing, chemical
impact on ecosystem, physical impact on ecosystem, structural impact on
ecosystem, indirect impact through interactions with other species.
Additional information such as the location of the impact is also
reported.</p>
<p>The data collection process for EICAT assessments involves several
key steps. First, raw impact records for the alien species are gathered
through an established search protocol using scientific literature,
databases, and other relevant sources. These impacts are then
categorised according to EICAT criteria. Each assessment undergoes a
rigorous review by the EICAT Authority, comprising experts from diverse
taxonomic groups and geographic regions, to ensure accuracy and
consistency. Once validated, assessments are published on the IUCN
Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), making them accessible to
scientists, conservation practitioners, and policymakers for
prioritising management actions and developing preventive or mitigation
measures (IUCN, 2020b). Currently, EICAT assessments in the GISD are not
fully open or FAIR, although efforts to address this are underway
(personal communication, P Genovesi). Available EICAT data can presently
be downloaded from <a href="https://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/" class="external-link uri">https://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/</a>. For species lacking
published assessments, users can independently conduct assessments
within the workflow.</p>

</h3>
<p>The EICAT categories are semi-quantitative (ordinal) data which need
to be transformed into numerical values to enable computation. The
transformation depends on the assumptions of the relationship between
the impact categories (e.g., linear) and the interpretation of the
minimal concern (e.g., zero impact). The transformation<br>
- <strong>MC = 0, MN = 1, MO = 2, MR = 3 and MV = 4</strong> assumes the
categories have a linear relationship and minimal impact implies zero
impact since no impact was found on the native species (e.g., Hagen
&amp; Kumschick 2018).<br>
- <strong>MC = 1, MN = 2, MO = 3, MR = 4 and MV = 5</strong> assumes a
linear relationship with minimal concern implying some concern even if
no impact was found on the native species’ individual (e.g., Jansen
&amp; Kumschick 2022). - <strong>MC = 0, MN = 10, MO = 100, MR = 1000
and MV = 10000</strong> assumes impact categories have an exponential
relationship and minimal concern is equal to zero impact (e.g.,
Rumlerová et al., 2016).</p>

</h2>
<p>Species are often reported to have multiple impact categories
specific to different study locations and mechanisms through which they
exert the impact. For example, Acacia dealbata has been categorised as
MR in Drakensberg, South Africa through structural impact but MN in
Biobio region, Chile (see dataset of Jansen &amp; Kumschick 2022). To
get an estimate of a likely impact category which could apply more
broadly, we aggregate the multiple impact scores per species into one
impact score per species. Aggregation methods include, overall maximum,
sum across maximum mechanism and overall mean. Additional statistics
will be included in future updates.<br>
- maximum: The maximum method assigns a species the maximum impact
across all records of the species (Blackburn et al., 2014; IUCN, 2020a;
Kumschick et al., 2024). It is best for precautionary approaches. Also,
the assumption is that the management of the highest impact can cover
for the lower impact caused by a species and can be the best when there
is low confidence in the multiple impacts of species of interest.
However, the maximum method can overestimate the impact of a species
especially when the highest impact requires specific or rare conditions
and many lower impacts were recorded.<br>
- sum across maximum mechanism: Assigns a species the summation of the
maximum impact per mechanism (Nentwig et al., 2010). The assumption is
that species with many mechanisms of impact have a higher potential to
cause impact.<br>
- mean: Assigns a species the mean impact of all the species impact.
This method computes the expected impact of the species considering all
species impact without differentiating between impacts (D’hondt et al.,
2015). This method is adequate when there are many impact records per
species. Finally, to compensate for regions (spatial areas or ranges of
occurrence data) with many sites (grid cells covering a region) having
higher overall impact value, we divide the impact value of each by the
number of sites occupied in the region.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="site-impact-indicator">Site impact indicator<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#site-impact-indicator"></a>
</h2>
<p>Multiple alien species can co-occur in a site. To get information on
how sites are affected by alien species (i.e. site impact), we aggregate
the different impacts per species in each site using one of five methods
proposed by Boulesnane-Genguant et al. (submitted). These methods are
precautionary, precautionary cumulative, mean, mean cumulative, and
cumulative which depend on the combinations of aggregation within
species and across species.<br>
- precautionary: This method uses the maximum method to aggregate each
species’ impact and then compute the maximum impact across species in
each site.<br>
- precautionary cumulative: Uses the maximum method to aggregate each
species’ impact and then compute the summation of all impacts in each
site. The precautionary cumulative method provides the highest impact
score possible for each species but considers the number of co-occurring
species in each site.<br>
- mean: Uses the mean method to aggregate each species’ impact and then
computes the mean of all species in each site. The mean provides the
expected impact within individual species and across all species in each
site.<br>
- mean cumulative: Uses the mean method to aggregate each species’
impact and then computes the summation of all impact scores in each
site. The mean cumulative provides the expected impact score within
individual species but adds co-occurring species’ impact scores in each
site.<br>
- cumulative: Uses the sum across maximum mechanism method to aggregate
each species’ impact and then computes the summation of all species’
impacts per site. The cumulative method provides a comprehensive view of
the overall impact while considering the impact and mechanisms of
multiple species.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to estimate the impacts of all the species in a study
area, we sum the impact values of all the sites for each year. Also, to
compensate for regions with many sites having higher overall impact
value, we divide the impact value of each by the number of sites
occupied in the region.</p>
