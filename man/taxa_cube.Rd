taxa_cube(
  taxa,
  region,
  limit = 500,
  country = NULL,
  res = 0.25,
  first_year = NULL,
  last_year = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{Character or dataframe. The character should be the scientific
name of the focal taxa while the dataframe is the GBIF occurrences data which
must contain columns "decimalLatitude", "decimalLongitude", "species",
"speciesKey", "coordinateUncertaintyInMeters", "dateIdentified", and "year".}

\item{region}{sf or character. The shapefile of the region of study or a
character which represent the name of a country}

\item{limit}{Number of records to return from GBIF download.
Default is set to 500}

\item{country}{Two-letter country code (ISO-3166-1) of the country for which
the GBIF occurrences data should be downloaded.}

\item{res}{The resolution of grid cells to be used. Default is 0.25}

\item{first_year}{The year from which the occurrence should start from}

\item{last_year}{The year at which the occurrence should end}
}
\value{
A data cube of \code{sim_cubes}
}
\description{
Prepare data cube to calculate species impact .
The function \code{taxa_cube} can take in the scientific name of the
taxa of interest as in character or GBIF occurrences data containing
necessary columns. The GBIF occurrences is downloaded if scientific
names is given.
