  x,
  region = NULL,
  first_year = NULL,
  last_year = NULL,
  title_lab = "Impact map",
  text_size = 14,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe of impact indicator. Must be a class of "site_impact"}

\item{region}{sf or character. The shapefile of the region of study or a
character which represent the name of a country. It is not compulsory
but makes the plot more comprehensible.}

\item{first_year}{The first year the impact map should include.
Default starts from the first year included in \code{x}.}

\item{last_year}{The last year the impact map should include.
Default ends in the last year included in \code{x}.}

\item{title_lab}{Title of the plot. Default is "Impact map"}

\item{text_size}{The size of the text of the plot. Default is "14"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to geom_tile}
}
\value{
The ggplot of species yearly impact on the region.
}
\description{
Produces the yearly impact map of a region
}

# define cube for taxa
acacia_cube <- taxa_cube(
  taxa = taxa_Acacia,
  region = southAfrica_sf,

)

# compute site impact
